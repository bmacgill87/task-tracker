# CS 3035 - Project #1 - Fall 2024

## Project Description
In this project, you will put what you have learned in class into practice and extend what you have learned to create an app using SimpleKit that allows editing different objects.

Your project is to be completed individually.

## Due Date
***October 30th, 2024***

## Requirements

You can select an application  for your project that interests you, but your goal should be to create one that fulfills the requirements below.

### Implementation Requirements

- Your application will be built using SimpleKit
- Your application must use an MVC design
- Your application should follow good design heuristics (where possible)
- Your application should employ CRAP design as much as possible
- Your application should provide at least two different views for some aspect of your model
- Your application must provide a consistent and appropriate look and feel (i.e., colours, fonts, etc.) for your project
- Your application should allow interacting and entering model information for at least three different types of domain objects (e.g., a calendar app might allow you to create/edit/delete users, meetings, and holidays)
- Domain objects should be able to be created, edited/updated/changed and deleted as appropriate through user or system actions
- Provide a set of exemplary domain objects that are pre-populated in your application
- Your application does not need to save its updated state when it is closed (i.e., the system will return to its original state upon restarting)
- Be creative - some points will be reserved for the complexity/creativity of the projects, but do not go too far

### Example Project Ideas

- A media organization/player app
- The ultimate todo app
- A personal budgeting app
- A simple 2D RPG game
- A tool to create RPG characters or plan simple campaigns
- A data charting tool... enter data and create charts
- Recreate an app you like using SimpleKit
- Your idea! If you have any questions, please get in touch with the instructors.

### Project Deliverables

- your working project code pushed by the due date to your repo
- a short one-page report describing your project, available in REPORT.md
- a video demonstration of your app (no longer than 3 mins long; if it's shorter, that's fine). The video can be narrated, but it should demonstrate all the main functionalities of your app. Upload your videos to D2L.


## Assessment

- Points will be awarded based on meeting the requirements above and providing a fully working, bug/error-free system that follows the basic principles of usability discussed in the lectures.
- A  portion of the project grade will be awarded for the creativity/complexity of your project (~25%)
